This directory contains reference submodules of/for the canonical cms docker projects, drupal and wordpress.

The reference submodules are lightly forked branches of the docker-library versions.

See the Simuliidae.md file in each one for details of how they are forked and maintained over time.

See the build directory for notes about how they are used.
