# This is used to build extended versions of the drupal image, with support for CiviCRM
# as well as production goodies that are not needed for testing or local/dev.
# Goodies include:
# 1. msmtprc: a way to send mail via the host's mail system
# 2. handling of varnish+hitch proxying by apache
# by default, do local building, but we could build from the blackfly repository when using automated build processes.

# Step 1. build the basic web service, a slightly extended version of the corresonding drupal modified base image.
